## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Custom external CSS (for font family)
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Centering elements using Flexbox with Tailwind utilities:

HTML-
<body class="bg-slate-300 h-screen flex justify-center items-center p-4 ">

- Utilize utility-first classes to quickly style components and achieve a clean layout.

- Separate custom fonts in an external CSS file and reference them in HTML:

CSS-
body {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}

### Continued development

Next, I want to dive deeper into:

Accessibility best practices (e.g., better use of <main> and correct semantic structure)

Building responsive components using Tailwind breakpoints

Organizing styles across multiple files more effectively

### Useful resources

Tailwind CSS Documentation - Helped me understand how to use utility classes for layout and design.

Frontend Mentor - The challenge platform that inspired this project.

W3Schools HTML Tutorial - Helped reinforce my understanding of HTML structure.
